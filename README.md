# KickStarter-Campaign-Analysis
Based on the questions asked, following are my observations from the Kickstarter projects:
1.	What are three conclusions we can make about Kickstarter campaigns given the provided data?
  a.	Based on ‘Category Pivot’ & ‘Sub-category Pivot’ sheets: the categories theatre & music are the most successful projects in the Kickstarter campaign. Amongst them, the plays & rock music lead as the sub-category.
  b.	Based on the ‘Pivot Chart line’ sheet: the projects are most successful during summer time-frame i.e. during the month of May-June-July. Also, the projects went live during first 3 months of the year i.e. Jan-Feb-Mar.
  c.	Based on the Bonus sheet: Projects that have been funded upto $5000 have shown successful results. Higher goals do not necessarily mean higher success.
2.	What are some of the limitations of this dataset?
    The data provided is the sample of the population which may or may not fully represent the population.
3.	What are some other possible tables/graphs that we could create?
  	Based on Country, which category/ sub-category has more success rate.
